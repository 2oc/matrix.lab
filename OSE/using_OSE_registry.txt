#### NOTES 
The ImageStream is an important component used by OSE.  It tracks images from a current and historical perspective.  This is an important point.  To keep track the image over different iterations.

When an image is needed, the openshift-master-controllers will reach out to gather details about the image (labels, tags, version, etc...) which it will track locally.
